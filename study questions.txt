1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
 
 forEach:  method doesn't actually return anything (undefined). It simply calls a provided function on each element in your array.
 map: utilizes return values and actually returns a new Array of the same size.


2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Function: a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
Method: actions that can be performed on objects.

3. What is closure?
a inner function that has access to the outer functions variables.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.


Principles: 
Default (window) Binding- When in the global scope, the value of “this” will be the window/console Object
Explicit Binding-Whenever JavaScript’s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.
Implicit Binding- Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this
New Binding -Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object
 that is created and returned by the constructor function.


unsure if these are considered rules to the principles? 

    Is the function called by new?
    Is the function called by call(), apply(), or bind()?
    Is the function called as a method, ie: obj.func()?

    Is the function called in the global scope?
        -If strict mode is enabled, return undefined.
       - Otherwise, return the global object, ie: window.



5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

The super() keyword  is used in order to call the methods of the parent class.
